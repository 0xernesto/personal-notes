# Big O Notation

## <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction</mark>

When it comes to problem-solving, multiple solutions often exist for a single problem. In computer science, an algorithm is a solution that systematically processes data to solve a specific problem. <mark style="color:yellow;">To asses and compare the efficiency of different algorithms, we have two standard measures of performance: time complexity and space complexity.</mark> These standard measures are essential when it comes to identifying the "best" solution to a particular computer science problem.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Big O notation, in simple terms, describes how code slows as data grows.</mark> It is a type of mathematical notation used to describe the time complexity or space complexity of algorithms.
