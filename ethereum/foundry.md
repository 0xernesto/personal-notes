# Foundry

## Introduction

Foundry is an alternative to tools like Hardhat, Truffle, Brownie, etc.

There are two main flaws with tools like Hardhat, Truffle, and Brownie:

1. They require the use of another language like JavaScript or Python for writing scripts.
2. They are slow.

Foundry is the superior choice is because:

1. Scripts can be written Solidity, the same language we use to write Ethereum smart contracts.
2. We can trigger actions and interact with deployed contracts directly from the command line, which is a very nice bonus.
3. Foundry is incredibly fast because it was written in Rust.

## Solidity Compiler Management

Foundry relies on [svm-rs](https://github.com/alloy-rs/svm-rs) to install and detect Solidity compiler versions. Working on multiple projects may require using different `solc` versions.

For a guide on how to manage `solc` versions, please refer to the [Solidity Compiler](solidity-compiler.md) section of these notes.

## Forge Commands

The `forge` command is used to build, test, and deploy smart contracts.

### Compile a Contract

* [Foundry Book - forge build](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-build)
* The following command will compile all contracts inside the `/src` directory and save the output in the `/out` directory.

```
forge build
```

### Deploy a Contract

* [Foundry Book - forge create](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-create)
* The `--etherscan-api-key <API_KEY> --verify` part is only required if you would like your contract to be automatically [verified](https://etherscan.io/verifyContract) on the chain's block explorer, which is highly recommended. You can get an API key by creating an account on the chain's block explorer (e.g., Etherscan, Arbiscan, Polygonscan, etc.).

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
forge create <CONTRACT_FILE_PATH>:<CONTRACT_NAME> --constructor-args <ARG1> <ARG2> --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --etherscan-api-key <API_KEY> --verify
```
{% endcode %}

### Run a Specific Unit Test

* [Foundry Book - forge test](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests)
* The following command assumes that the unit test will be running on a forked network.
* The `-vvvvv` flag specifies the level of verbosity (i.e., how much detail to display in the terminal as the test runs). In this case, we are specifying the highest level (Level 5).\
  \
  If we don't specify this flag, Level 1 is assumed, `-vv` = Level 2, `-vvv` = Level 3, etc.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
forge test --fork-url <RPC_URL> --match-test <TEST_NAME> -vvvvv
```
{% endcode %}

### Run All Unit Tests

* [Foundry Book - forge test](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests)
* The following command assumes that the unit test will be running on a forked network.
* Also, the minimum amount of detail will be displayed in the terminal as the tests run, since the default verbosity is Level 1.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
forge test --fork-url <RPC_URL>
```
{% endcode %}

## Cast Commands

The `cast` command is used to perform Ethereum RPC calls to deployed smart contracts.

### Call a Function

* [Foundry Book - cast call](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-call)
* Calling a contract function **does not modify any on-chain data**. This is simply a way to read data returned by the function that we call using the `cast call` command.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "functionName(<PARAM1_TYPE>, <PARAM2_TYPE>)" <PARAM1> <PARAM2> --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
```
{% endcode %}

### Submit a Transaction

* [Foundry Book - cast send](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-send)
* Submitting a transaction to a contract function **will modify on-chain data.** In order to successfully do this, we need to sign the transaction with our private key and pay the corresponding gas fee.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "functionName(<PARAM1_TYPE>, <PARAM2_TYPE>)" <PARAM1> <PARAM2> --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```
{% endcode %}

### Send Native Token to Account

The amount can be an integer, which defaults to Wei, or you can specify the units. For example `1ether`.

```
cast send <SOME_ADDRESS> --value <AMOUNT> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

### Get the Keccak-256 Hash of a UTF-8 String

```
cast from-utf8 "hello world"
```

### Generate Calldata from a Function Selector and Argument Values

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
cast calldata "somFunc(address,uint256)" 0x37df0c956cdcd13C0EF28fC72D33011001e98DA2 123456
```
{% endcode %}

## Testing on Local Mainnet Fork

### Create a Local Fork

The `anvil` command is used to create a local Mainnet fork for deploying and testing smart contracts.

[Foundry Book - anvil reference](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/anvil/)

* The `--chain-id` and `--port` commands are optional.
* If `--chain-id` is not specified, the default value is set to it's Mainnet counterpart (i.e., chain ID would be 1 for Ethereum).
* If `--port` is not specified, the default value is set to 8545.

```
anvil --fork-url <RPC_URL> --chain-id <CHAIN_ID> --port <PORT>
```

### Impersonate an Account

This allows you to submit transactions as if you were the owner of the account you are impersonating.

```
cast rpc anvil_impersonateAccount <SOME_ADDRESS>
```

## Common Errors

### code 128

When installing git submodules using `forge install`, the installation may fail with the error <mark style="color:red;">`git submodule exited with code 128`</mark>. This is typically due to initiating the project's git repository without using `forge init`.

To get around this, do the following:

```bash
forge install $SUBMODULE_URL --no-commit
git add -A
git commit -m "forge install: sumboduleName"
```
